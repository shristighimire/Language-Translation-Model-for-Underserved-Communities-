# Language Translation Model for Underresourced Languages

## Overview

This project focuses on improving translation accuracy for underserved communities, specifically translating between Nepali, Mongolian, Tigrinya, and English. The system uses **GPT-3** fine-tuned with custom datasets from these languages and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** files to enhance contextual understanding, achieving a 63% improvement in translation accuracy. The project also deploys the model on **AWS SageMaker**, reducing processing time by 40% and enabling the system to handle 1,000 requests per minute.

## Key Features

- **Fine-tuned GPT-3** model for Nepali, Mongolian, and Tigrinya translations.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** files for improved translation accuracy.
- Deployment on **AWS SageMaker** for scalable, low-latency translation.
- 63% improvement in translation accuracy and 40% reduction in processing time.
